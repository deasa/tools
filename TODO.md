Creating a probability library is a great way to centralize common calculations and functionality for various gaming scenarios. Here are some features you might want to consider supporting:

Basic Probability Calculations: This includes the calculation of single event probabilities, combined probabilities, independent events, dependent events, conditional probabilities, and the use of Bayes' Theorem.

Permutations and Combinations: These are essential calculations for many game scenarios. This includes being able to calculate the number of possible combinations or permutations of a set of items (like cards or dice), which is often the basis for probability calculations.

Probability Distributions: Support for various probability distributions could be useful, especially for more complex games. This might include binomial, geometric, Poisson, normal, uniform, and exponential distributions.

Expected Value and Variance: These are basic statistics concepts that come up frequently in gaming scenarios. They give you the 'average' outcome and the variability around that average.

Monte Carlo Simulations: These are simulations that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They can be used when analytical methods are too complex.

Markov Chains: These are mathematical systems that experience transitions from one state to another according to certain probabilistic rules. They can be very useful for modeling games where the outcome depends on the current state and not the history of previous states.

Game Theory Concepts: Depending on how complex your games are, you might want to consider including basic game theory concepts like Nash Equilibrium.

Multiplayer Probability Calculations: Many games involve more than one player, and this can significantly impact the probabilities involved. You might need to calculate, for example, the probability of one player achieving a certain outcome given the outcomes of other players.

Keep in mind that while many of these concepts apply broadly to various games, each game will have its own unique set of rules and constraints that will impact the way probabilities are calculated. As such, you may also need to include game-specific functionality or be prepared to extend your library as needed to support different games.

Here are some examples of basic probability calculations that your library should support:

Single Event Probabilities: This is the most basic type of probability. For example, if a die is rolled, what is the probability of getting a 3? This can be computed as 1/6, since there is one favorable outcome (getting a 3) and six possible outcomes in total.

Combined Probabilities (AND): This is where you need to find the probability of multiple events all happening. For example, if two dice are rolled, what is the probability of both being 3? This can be computed as 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.

Combined Probabilities (OR): This is where you need to find the probability of at least one of multiple events happening. For example, if a die is rolled, what is the probability of getting a 3 or a 4? This can be computed as 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3.

Independent Events: Independent events are those where the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of the other. For example, rolling a die and tossing a coin are independent events.

Dependent Events: Dependent events are those where the outcome of one event does affect the outcome of the other. For example, drawing cards from a deck without replacement.

Conditional Probabilities: This is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. For example, if two dice are rolled, what is the probability that the second die is a 3 given that the first die was a 4?

Use of Bayes' Theorem: This is a way to find a probability when certain other probabilities are known. For example, if a rare disease affects 1 in 1000 people and a test is 99% accurate, you can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that someone who tests positive actually has the disease.

For all these calculations, the library should provide a way to input the relevant probabilities and compute the result. Also, the library should handle cases where probabilities are expressed as ratios, percentages, or decimal fractions.
